MD5Crack DEMO
=========
This is a program that cracks MD5-hashes and generates rainbow tables. It is written in Java.
The program has also a hash table implementation.

For more info on rainbow tables, check http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table and http://lasec.epfl.ch/pub/lasec/doc/Oech03.pdf

NOTICE! This program should not be used for actual cracking, since it has no multithreading and no support for large files. Turn to rcrack instead.

For a multithreaded version, check branch 'threaded'.
